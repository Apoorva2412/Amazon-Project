       "jason robert brown has long been hailed as one of the guiding lights of the future of musical theatre, one of the torch bearers for the kind of intelligent, complex, and fascinating theatre that stephen sondheim has given us for the past few decades.  parade and songs for a new worlds certainly gave reason to believe this was true, but the last five years is jason robert brown's chamber musical magnum opus.  each and every song is tightly crafted, the lyrics are witty, insightful, and cut to the quick of the failing relationship that the show follows.  the seamless blending of the two different versions of the story and the adeptness with which the composer goes from the despair of songs like cathy's \"still hurting\" and \"see i'm smiling\" as her and jamie's relationship dies, to the hysterical \"shiksa goddess\" and \"a miracle would happen\", which jamie sings earlier in the relationship as he approaches their life together with a sense of hope that only youth and optimism can offer, is truly remarkable and better than almost anything else in the musical theatre canon.\\nnorbert leo butz and sherie renee scott manage to make both characters, despite their very apparent flaws and frequent mistakes, likeable and easily relatable.  there is no clear villain here, and that is the heart break of the situation.  these are two remarkable people who you wish desperately could work things out, and yet you see, as they do, that there is little to be done to save this relationship from it's inevitably depressing end.  i won't kid you, if you listen to the cd the whole way through you aren't going to be skipping around the house, all sunshine and roses, but you will be struck by the compelling honesty with which this all too common scenario is played out, both by composer and performers.        1\n",

       "it's nice to see a greatest hits cd that actually has all the greatest hits of that band on it.  often bands will put half their hits on one cd along with a bunch of songs nobody cares about, and put the other hits on a volume 2 greatest hits to make more money.  foreigner did the right thing by putting anything you could ever want from them on one cd.  it's loaded with good stuff from their early to later days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "jason robert brown has long been hailed as one of the guiding lights of the future of musical theatre, one of the torch bearers for the kind of intelligent, complex, and fascinating theatre that stephen sondheim has given us for the past few decades.  parade and songs for a new worlds certainly gave reason to believe this was true, but the last five years is jason robert brown's chamber musical magnum opus.  each and every song is tightly crafted, the lyrics are witty, insightful, and cut to the quick of the failing relationship that the show follows.  the seamless blending of the two different versions of the story and the adeptness with which the composer goes from the despair of songs like cathy's \"still hurting\" and \"see i'm smiling\" as her and jamie's relationship dies, to the hysterical \"shiksa goddess\" and \"a miracle would happen\", which jamie sings earlier in the relationship as he approaches their life together with a sense of hope that only youth and optimism can offer, is truly remarkable and better than almost anything else in the musical theatre canon.\\nnorbert leo butz and sherie renee scott manage to make both characters, despite their very apparent flaws and frequent mistakes, likeable and easily relatable.  there is no clear villain here, and that is the heart break of the situation.  these are two remarkable people who you wish desperately could work things out, and yet you see, as they do, that there is little to be done to save this relationship from it's inevitably depressing end.  i won't kid you, if you listen to the cd the whole way through you aren't going to be skipping around the house, all sunshine and roses, but you will be struck by the compelling honesty with which this all too common scenario is played out, both by composer and performers.        1\n",

       "it's nice to see a greatest hits cd that actually has all the greatest hits of that band on it.  often bands will put half their hits on one cd along with a bunch of songs nobody cares about, and put the other hits on a volume 2 greatest hits to make more money.  foreigner did the right thing by putting anything you could ever want from them on one cd.  it's loaded with good stuff from their early to later days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "jason robert brown has long been hailed as one of the guiding lights of the future of musical theatre, one of the torch bearers for the kind of intelligent, complex, and fascinating theatre that stephen sondheim has given us for the past few decades.  parade and songs for a new worlds certainly gave reason to believe this was true, but the last five years is jason robert brown's chamber musical magnum opus.  each and every song is tightly crafted, the lyrics are witty, insightful, and cut to the quick of the failing relationship that the show follows.  the seamless blending of the two different versions of the story and the adeptness with which the composer goes from the despair of songs like cathy's \"still hurting\" and \"see i'm smiling\" as her and jamie's relationship dies, to the hysterical \"shiksa goddess\" and \"a miracle would happen\", which jamie sings earlier in the relationship as he approaches their life together with a sense of hope that only youth and optimism can offer, is truly remarkable and better than almost anything else in the musical theatre canon.\\nnorbert leo butz and sherie renee scott manage to make both characters, despite their very apparent flaws and frequent mistakes, likeable and easily relatable.  there is no clear villain here, and that is the heart break of the situation.  these are two remarkable people who you wish desperately could work things out, and yet you see, as they do, that there is little to be done to save this relationship from it's inevitably depressing end.  i won't kid you, if you listen to the cd the whole way through you aren't going to be skipping around the house, all sunshine and roses, but you will be struck by the compelling honesty with which this all too common scenario is played out, both by composer and performers.        1\n",

       "it's nice to see a greatest hits cd that actually has all the greatest hits of that band on it.  often bands will put half their hits on one cd along with a bunch of songs nobody cares about, and put the other hits on a volume 2 greatest hits to make more money.  foreigner did the right thing by putting anything you could ever want from them on one cd.  it's loaded with good stuff from their early to later days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
